# react-job-directory
For this project I created an app using React to list the various jobs in the area for users to research. <br>
The user can enter a specific job that they want in the searchbox <br> As well as the location they want the work.<br>
The user has several options and can interact with the app by clicking previous and next pages for more.<br>
This app uses the following npm packages: <br>
Axios <br> React <br> React-bootstrap <br> React-dom <br> React-markdown <br> React-scripts <br> Webpack <br>
Deployed app is: <br>
